# Los Pueblos Magicos De Mexico (The Magical Towns of Mexico) 

Ever visited Mexico or thought about visiting? If you are like a lot of people (including my younger self), when you think of Mexico, Cancun or Tijuana may come to mind. Mexico has a rich and colorful history with various climates and terrains. The Pueblos Magicos are Magical towns located all over Mexico. I've created an API that will show you the true beauty of Mexico and hopefully encourage you to visit one (or many) of these Pueblos! I hope you enjoy and happy exploring!
