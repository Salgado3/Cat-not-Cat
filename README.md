# Is it a Cat?

Ever wonder if there is a cat in the photo? No? Well,... regardless... if you ever DID wonder, I made this web app that allows you to upload a photo and have Microsoft's Azure Computer Vision detect if there is a cat in the photo.

## How It's Made:

I created a web app using Microsoft's Azure Computer Vision. I read their documentation and utilized their code template to begin. Computer Vision recognizes objects found in photos. The photos are hosted on Cloudinary. I used JavaScript to find cats in photos and display in EJS.

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Cloudinary, Microsoft Azure Computer Vision
